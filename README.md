# BCA Home Services Project
This Project is a web-based platform designed to connect users with home service providers for a variety of tasks such as cleaning, plumbing, electrical work, and more. The system allows users to book services, manage their appointments, and view available service providers in their area, while service providers can manage their service offerings and availability. An admin panel is included to oversee users, services, and bookings.

This project is built using PHP, MySQL, and is designed to run on a XAMPP server.
